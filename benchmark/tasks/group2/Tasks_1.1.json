Key aspects include:   1. Inspection Cycle and Frequency: Gloves must undergo periodic inspection at least once every six months.   2. Inspection Records:   Inspection Chart: A standardized form (\"Form 1 Periodic Inspection Chart for Electrical Insulated Rubber Gloves for High Voltage/Low Voltage\") is used to record inspection data for each glove. This chart is managed collectively by section. Chart Contents: The chart includes the inspection date (as per the manufacturer's report), reviewer, investigators, approver, glove control number, glove specifications (name, model number, manufacturer), location of use, manufacturer's inspection results (external inspection and pressure resistance test – \"○\" for both good, \"×\" if either is defective), and any additional notes (e.g., new purchase, disposal, replacement).  3. Glove Control Number:   Format: A five-character alphanumeric code (Section Abbreviation - Glove Serial Number). Section Abbreviation: Unique alphanumeric code assigned per section. Glove Serial Number: Numeric sequence (001-999). Marking: The control number is clearly marked (approximately 10mm square, black permanent marker) on the back of the wrist of each glove.  4. Inspection Pass Indication: Each glove is stamped with the date of passing the inspection. This date determines the next inspection date.   5. Manufacturer's Inspection Report:   Content: Includes external inspection results and pressure resistance test results (both must be \"good\"). Additionally, it must legally include the manufacturer's name, inspection date, method, location, inspector's name, and any remedial actions taken. High Voltage Test Values: 20,000V (new), 10,000V (periodic). Low Voltage Test Values: 3,000V (new), 1,500V (periodic). Defective Gloves: Gloves marked as \"defective\" must be discarded and replaced with spares. Inspection Provider: Kyowa PV Co., Ltd. (via WWW).  6. Record Retention: Inspection charts and reports must be retained as quality records for a minimum of three years, as required by law."
