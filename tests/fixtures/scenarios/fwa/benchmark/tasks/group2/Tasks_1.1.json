Wear appropriate safety equipment. Stop work and contact a supervisor if any abnormalities occur.    Lower the Lifter: Lower the lifter using the lowering lever.    Remove the Solder Tank: Pull out the solder tank using the drawer lever.    Nozzle Removal and Cleaning: Remove nozzle fixing screws. Carefully remove nozzles using pliers, collecting spilled solder. Disassemble and clean nozzles, removing solder oxides from the straightening plate, wire mesh, and jet guide. (At least weekly). Consult the manufacturer's manual for proper disassembly procedures.    Nozzle Reassembly: Reassemble the nozzles, ensuring a secure fit to prevent floating or tilting.    Raise the Lifter: Raise the lifter using the lift lever.    Soldering Condition Verification: Check wave height, width, and solder level to ensure they meet specifications.    Resume Soldering Operation: Once soldering conditions are confirmed to be within the prescribed range and soldering performance is satisfactory, resume the soldering operation."
